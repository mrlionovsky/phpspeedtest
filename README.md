This is a simple script to test the internet speed between you and your server.

Installation is easy—just copy the index.php file to any directory on your server. Guaranteed to work on PHP 5.2+.

ONLY FOR NOT PUBLIC USE!!! Ideally the script should not be "publicly" located, since there are problems with UA verification, which I have not fixed.

License: "as-is" and WTFPL. Do whatever you want—create a full-fledged SpeedTest clone or even run it through a neural network for improvements. Forks and feedback are welcome!
